# Issues tracker

GitHub comes with an integrated issues tracker that we can use for keeping track of work on tasks and general communication.

## Creating an issue

To create a new issue within a particular repo, click the issues tab.  You'll see the list of existing open issues (if any).  To create a new issue, click on the `New issue` button.

Enter a title for the issue and write text explaining the issue in the box.  You  can use the @mention system to make sure that relevant people are informed about the issue.  If you want to assign the issue to some particular team member, clicking on the Assignees item will give a dropdown list of collaborators.  

It's also a good thing to assign a *label* to the project.  Labels are like tags in other systems.  Assigning a label categorizes the issues so they can be searched.  It's also a very visual way to know the status and category of an issue and shows up in the issues list.

When you click on the Label item and a dropdown of possible labels appears.  You can select one of the labels or click on the Edit icon to create a new label.

We don't see the label we need, so click on the `New label` button.  You can select the name, description, and color you want, then click on the `Create label` button.

Once the label is created, you can select it and any other labels you want to apply.  Back at the issue editing screen, you can click the button to submit the new issue.

Anyone on the team can reply to the issue and GitHub tracks all of the actions taken related to the issue.  You can also cross-reference other issues by typing the issue number after a hash (`#`) character.

In the rendered comment, you can mouse over the linked issue to see the details.  When the issue is resolved, you can close it with a comment.

The reference to the issue also shows up in the record of the referenced issue.  

In writing comments, you can use any of the normal Markdown formatting features as well as to add hyperlinks to anywhere within or outside of Github.

You can use the preview tab to see how it will look.  Here's how the final rendered version looks.

## Using the issues tracker as a mailing list

You can "watch" a repo by clicking on the `Watch` button at the upper right of the screen.  Watching a repo notifies you of all conversations related to the repo, so depending on your settings, you can get an email whenever someone creates an issue or comments.

This provides a convenient way to manage an organizational email "listserv". An "issue" can actually be something like a meeting announcement, with links to agendas, Google Hangout links, etc.  

-----

------

 Because responses to the issue are tracked on the same page, this effectively keeps the "thread" organized sequentially.  If any collaborator loses the email, they can always find the message by looking at the issue.  

 Here's what the email looks like that was generated by a response to the original meeting announcement issue.  The response is in the body of the email text.  There is also a link that will take the reader directly to the issue page on GitHub for additional responses.  Responding to the email automatically adds the response as a comment to the issue thread.

 ------

When the issue is closed (in this case after the meeting has occurred), the issue disappears from the open issues list, although it remains in the closed issues list as a premanent record of the conversation.  

Using the issue tracker in this way makes it possible for project participants who are less involved in the activities to see at a glance what's currently going on with the project, simply by looking at the open issues on the tracker.
